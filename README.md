**FNum** is a lightweight Java library for basic numerical linear algebra operations. It provides a simple and intuitive API for working with dense real-valued matrices, supporting operations such as addition, scaling, transposition, inversion, and determinant computation.

This library is intended for educational purposes and small-scale numerical computations. Large matrices or performance-critical applications may require more specialized libraries (e.g., Apache Commons Math or EJML).

> ⚠️ This project is for practicing all subjects done in my lecture. There can be errors or bad runtimes for some implementations
